We've always had wonderful service here, even when they are busy. These servers work hard so BE kind to them! We will continue to make this a tradition stop! <br>
        <br> Iris S. <br> Troy, MI <br> Shockingly good!<br> Got the chicken broccoli pizza and was pleasantly surprised. Chicken was delicious, pizza was super garlicky and flavorful. Loved every bite of it. Their pastas were tasty too.<br> This is the spot to go to when you're in Houghton!<br>
        <br> Rick N. <br> Fishers, IN <br> Went with my parents while I was in town. The inside of the restaurant/bar is like stepping back in time. You're instantly brought back to the early 30's. Great views of the bridge and water.
        Our waitress was awesome, but it did seem like it took a little too long to get our food. Everyone loved their dishes, from Caesars Salad With Alaskan salmon, the small pizza, the lasagna, to the cudighi, were all delicious. I wish they'd give something other than chips.
        All reasonably priced.<br>
