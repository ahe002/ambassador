    <h2 class = "title text center"><br>AMBASSADOR HISTORY</h2>

    <p class = "para text center">On January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant opened under new ownership. 
    The new owners, the Rossi family, had transformed the space from a tap bar into a <br>restaurant that specialized in pizza and sandwiches. 
    In 1978, the Ambassador was expanded into the space next door, and the second dining room was added. <br>
    In January 2007, the Ambassador became a non-smoking establishment. To explain the history of the Ambassador and the unique murals that line the<br> interior walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem detailing the story. 
    The poem, entitled "Come Fill a Bumper," has since been printed on <br>the cover of the Ambassador menu. (see below for full text)</p>

    <p class = "para text center">The first line of the poem mentions "Mr. Rohrbeck," who was “given a job to do.” 
    Rohrbeck, the mural artist, was commissioned by Joseph Bosch (born in<br> Baden, Germany in 1850) to paint the murals specifically for the Bosch brewery (closed in 1978). 
    The murals were later placed in the "old Giltedge Bar."<br> 
    Featuring gnomes in various states of celebration, the murals are oil on canvas, with several coats of varnish on top for preservation. 
    The date that the<br> paintings were sold to the Ambassador and transferred from the Bosch Brewery is unclear, but the transaction likely took place in the late 40s or early 50s<br> during a remodeling project.</p>

    <p class = "para text center">The Ambassador retains the original charm and tradition of its original inception; in addition to the murals,<br>
    which have remained in place for over 50 years, the original pizza recipe is still used to create the Ambassador pizzas.</p>

    <h2 class = "title text center"><br>Come Fill a Bumper</h2>

    <p class = "para text center">On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job to do.<br>
    With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the masterpiece on the wall above.<br>
    First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of here, but not too far.<br>
    Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for horses, business was good.<br>
    Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any old time.<br>
    Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall”<br>
    Paintings were rolled and stored away, for twelve long years in the dust they lay.<br>
    At last came nineteen thirty-three, the law was repealed and Bacchus was free.<br>
    Saloons and taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and drank spirits once more.<br>
    The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings were hung on the walls they now grace.<br>
    The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still enjoy them as much as they do.</p>
